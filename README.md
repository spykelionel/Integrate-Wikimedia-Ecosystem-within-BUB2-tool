Project timeline for Integrate Wikimedia Ecosystem within BUB2 tool

# Project Description
### Integrate Wikimedia Ecosystem within the BUB2 tool

BUB2 tool helps community members upload books, newspapers, magazines, gazettes, etc. from public libraries such as Google Books, Panjab Digital Library, and Trove Digital Library to Internet Archive. BUB2 has been helpful for the Wikisource community to import texts from different public libraries to Wikisource. Currently, Wikisource volunteers are using the BUB2 tool to import texts to the Internet Archive and the IA Upload tool to import them back to Wikimedia Commons. The latter could be easily deprecated by integrating the Wikimedia ecosystem (Commons, Wikidata, and Wikisource) in the BUB2 tool so that volunteers can directly upload the texts to Wikisource and correctly cite them to Wikidata items.

# Internship Tasks
Some main tasks for this internship include: 

1. Set up a polling mechanism to get .djvu files from Internet Archive
2. Integrate MediaWiki API to upload the .djvu file and metadata to Commons
3. Integrate Wikidata API to cite the metadata correctly so that it can be reused in Wikisource and other places
## Optional Stretch Goals:
1. Create pages on Wikisource automatically with the djvu file and metadata
You may start with some smaller tasks to understand the codebase such as allowing multi-lingual book upload, integrating email API to send emails, and adding a search bar in the queue.
